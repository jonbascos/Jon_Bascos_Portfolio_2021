                Having lived in Oregon since 2005, I grew up in the Bay Area and have since fallen in love with the Pacific Northwest.  For the most part, you get all four seasons and, yes, even snow every once in a while during the winter months.  It is definitely slower in the PNW than the hustle and bustle of the Bay and it was a welcome change.

                I got into EMS (Emergency Medical Service) in late 2011 as an EMT and then became a Paramedic four years later.  It is one of the most rewarding careers I've ever had.  I got to see people in the absolute worst moments of their lives and I was the one that was tasked to help make it better.  After about eight years, I decided it was time for a change.  Burnout became real.  Not many people realize that the average career length for anyone in EMS is about five years! The tech bug came crawling back and I was again inspired to create another website.  But I had been "out of the game" for years.  That didn't stop me though. I started utilizing anything I could (YouTube, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, etc). But, at that time, I wasn't making as much progress as I would have liked. At that time, I decided to drop down to Part-Time in EMS to pursue my dream of becoming a developer.  That is when I enrolled in a coding Bootcamp called PDX Code Guild in 2019 and graduated from the program 14-weeks later.  It was pretty brutal at times, but my cohort and I made it through. Luckily I'm pretty resourceful when it comes to finding solutions to problems.  Google and Stack Overflow became my friends. I had a better understanding of Javascript and Python at the end of the Bootcamp.  But I also gained some new friends, colleagues, and a renewed spirit to break into the industry.
